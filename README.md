# GroupDice

This is a simple C# app that is designed for a group of players to roll stats for D&D

The idea is that each of the players comes to the DM computer and clicks a roll button to contribute to the pool.
After everyone has rolled, everyone picks their favorite set of stats and uses it to make a character (reassigning as the party agrees that's how they'd like to roll


The tool offers several options for rolling as well as a couple tools.
1) Expression Roller - A standard dice expression interpretor (i.e. 3d6+5, %, etc)
2) Grid Stats - Another method of generating starting stats. Click all of the buttons to generate a grid of stats, then assign each to an appropriate spot. Each number may only be used once.
